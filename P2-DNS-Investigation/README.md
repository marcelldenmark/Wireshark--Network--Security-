# Project 2 – DNS Investigation

## DNS Investigation Using Wireshark

### Objective
To observe and analyze DNS traffic generated by a macOS system using Wireshark.

### Environment
- Operating System: macOS
- Tool: Wireshark
- Network Interface: Wi-Fi (en0)

### Method
- Captured live network traffic using Wireshark
- Filtered traffic to display only DNS packets
- Generated DNS queries by visiting common websites
- Generated failed DNS queries using a non-existent domain

### Findings
- Observed DNS A record queries for common domains such as google.com and linkedin.com
- Identified DNS responses containing IP addresses and CNAME records
- Observed NXDOMAIN responses for invalid domain requests
- Confirmed normal DNS resolution behavior through the local router

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates basic DNS traffic analysis skills, including capturing, filtering, and interpreting DNS queries and responses.
