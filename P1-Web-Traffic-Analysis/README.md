# Project 1 – Web Traffic Analysis

## Web Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark

---

## Objective
To observe and analyze web traffic generated by a macOS system using Wireshark, focusing on HTTP, HTTPS, and encrypted communication patterns.

---

## Environment
- Operating System: macOS
- Tool: Wireshark
- Network Interface: Wi-Fi (en0)

---

## Method
- Captured live network traffic using Wireshark
- Applied display filters to isolate web-related traffic
- Inspected packet details to understand client-server communication

---

## Analysis Performed
- Identified HTTP and HTTPS traffic
- Observed TLS handshakes and encrypted payloads
- Followed TCP streams to analyze session behavior
- Reviewed packet metadata such as IP addresses, ports, and flags

---

## Findings
- Most modern web traffic is encrypted using TLS
- HTTP traffic is minimal and often redirected to HTTPS
- TCP is the primary transport protocol for web communication
- Encrypted traffic hides payload content but exposes metadata useful for analysis

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates foundational web traffic analysis skills using Wireshark. Understanding normal web communication patterns is essential for detecting abnormal or malicious activity in real-world network environments.
