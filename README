# Wireshark Network Security Labs

## Overview
This repository contains hands-on network security analysis labs performed using Wireshark on macOS.  
The projects focus on real-world SOC-style traffic analysis, baseline establishment, and anomaly detection.

Each project builds foundational skills used by security analysts to inspect network traffic, identify suspicious behavior, and document findings clearly.
