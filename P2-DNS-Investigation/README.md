# Project 2 – DNS Investigation

## Objective
Analyze DNS traffic to understand how domain names are resolved to IP addresses and identify normal versus abnormal DNS behavior.

## Why This Matters
DNS is the first step in almost all network communication. Analysts use DNS to determine where traffic is attempting to go before encryption occurs.
