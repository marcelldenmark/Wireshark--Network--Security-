## Findings
- Plaintext HTTP traffic was not observed
- Web traffic primarily used HTTPS over TCP port 443
- TLS-encrypted application data was identified
- Normal TCP behavior observed including ACK, FIN, and occasional RST packets
- No signs of abnormal latency or excessive retransmissions

## Conclusion
The capture demonstrates normal encrypted web communication. HTTPS traffic was successfully established and terminated using standard TCP session behavior, indicating healthy client-server interaction during browsing activity.
